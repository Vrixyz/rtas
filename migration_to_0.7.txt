  - component addition changes: with() -> insert()
  - some ecs imports now in prelude
  - stage namespaces moved a bit (CamelCase-ified)
  - stage declaration explicit about parallelization
  - "Visibility" struct used instead of "Draw"
  - Orthographic and UI camera construction

New errors appearing
- glam changes : .x() -> .x ; set_x() -> x = new_val
- rust analyzer or the error lens a bit lost, having trouble to keep showing me errors directly in files :(
- EntityCommand API with `commands.entity(entity)` or `.id()`

Rapier:
